<h3>
  Joon Hee Jang
</h3>

<p>
  Hello, my name is Joon Hee Jang. I grew up in South Korea and moved to the US for graduate studies in chemistry. 
  I am currently living in Texas and working as a product development engineer at a biotech company.
</p>

<p>
  I have a great passion for learning new things, and recently developed a keen interest in Python programming and data science. 
  I had experiences in mathematical modeling and simulation of scientific data, 
  but I found analyzing real-life data and predicting future outcomes with statistical models really fascinate me.
</p>

<p>
  I would like to share my thoughts and what I am learning through this blog 
  and would like to be connected with others who has the same interests.
