# About Me

Hello, my name is Joon Hee Jang. I grew up in South Korea and moved to the US for graduate studies in chemistry. I am currently living in Texas and working as a product development engineer at a biotech company.


I have a great passion for learning new things, and recently developed a keen interest in Python programming and data science. I had experiences in mathematical modeling and simulation of scientific data, but I found analyzing real-life data and predicting future outcomes with statistical models really fascinate me.


I would like to share my thoughts and what I am learning through this blog and would like to be connected with others who has the same interests.
